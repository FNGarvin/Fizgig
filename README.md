## What Fizgig is

Every trainer makes LoRAs. Fizgig is built around what you do with them **afterwards** — and that's the part nobody else has.

- **Fix** a baked LoRA block-by-block, no retraining — overbaked identity, crushed style, drag a slider, save a new `.safetensors`.
- **Explore** new variations like a game — the app proposes mutations, you pick favourites, the LoRA evolves through selection.
- **Find** the best LoRA by eye — render every epoch of a run (or any folder of LoRAs) on one seed and crossfade to the one that *feels* right.
- **Share** what you made — export the epoch morph, or travel a single LoRA through seeds, prompts, or strength, as a looping MP4/GIF made to share.
- **Profile** exactly which blocks carry identity, style, and detail — so you know what to touch before you touch it.

Under that workbench sits a fast, light trainer tuned for a single model. Because everything is built for Klein 9B instead of bolted on to a dozen models, the whole thing can do things the generalists can't: a full 9B LoRA trains comfortably on a **16 GB card**, fp8 steps run **~1.5× faster** on RTX 40/50-series, and the post-training tools all read each other's output.

**Free and open source.** A good first run is the **✨ Old Reliable** preset on the Training tab — then try **✨ Old Reliable · Flavour 8** (rank 8). Much of the old rank-16 instinct predates models this size; on Klein 9B, rank 8 is often plenty.

---

## The workbench

The reason to use Fizgig. Each tool works on a trained run's output **or any Klein LoRA you've downloaded** — and they hand off to each other.

### Repair Studio
Thirty-two live sliders — one per transformer block — with a side-by-side Distilled preview that updates instantly. **Turbo Preview** caches activations and prompt encodings for up to **97% faster** late-block edits. Quick-set buttons on every slider (`[0]` `[1]` `[±]` `[⚖]`); **Balance** holds the combined primary + donor weight at 1.0 per block, ideal for cross-fading two LoRAs. Optional donor-LoRA blending mixes blocks from a second LoRA via rank concatenation. Previews can be conditioned on a **reference image** (Klein is an edit model), so you see how your LoRA edits a real photo. Click a preview to pop it into a resizable window. Browse a new LoRA and it auto-swaps — no manual reset. Saves a baked `.safetensors` that works in ComfyUI at strength 1.0.

### LoRA the Explorer
Evolutionary discovery. The app mutates blocks and shows four variants — pick a favourite and it becomes the new baseline. **Freeze Tweaked Blocks** locks what you like so future mutations only touch the rest. A **Structure** slider sets how far the composition anchor drifts each round; seed cycling checks variants across seeds. Found a direction you love? **Refine this baseline in Repair Studio** sends all 32 slider values straight over — and Repair Studio sends state back the same way. Discover → refine → discover, in a loop.

### LoRA Royale
Find the best LoRA the human way — then turn the winner into share-ready clips. Point it at a training output folder and it renders **every epoch on one fixed seed** (Distilled 4-step), with a **crossfade slider** that blends smoothly between consecutive epochs — drag until it looks best and stop. A thumbnail grid sits below; click any epoch to jump there. Drop in a **reference image** (Klein is an edit model) and every epoch edits the same photo. An optional **likeness score** (InsightFace ArcFace, CPU — no extra VRAM) rates each epoch against a training shot, flags the closest in gold with one-click **Jump to best**, and **Promote** copies the winner to a clean `.safetensors`. Not a training run? Point it at **any folder of LoRAs** and it compares them by name — or flip to **Single-LoRA mode** to run everything below on one downloaded LoRA, no folder required.

Because the morph *is* the magic, the payoff is four **travel** tools that each render a sequence you **scrub to review and only save if you like it** — as a looping MP4 or GIF, re-saveable in either format without re-rendering, with an optional **deflicker** pass (the timelapse trick DaVinci uses) for flicker-free clips. **Export the morph** saves the whole epoch sweep, a face resolving epoch by epoch. **Seed travel** slerps through a journey of seeds to show the LoRA's range. **Prompt travel** interpolates the text embedding through waypoints — Time of day, Season, Age, Era, or your own words — so one subject flows through the change; pick a **Preset + Subject** and it writes the prompt for you. And **LoRA strength travel** ramps the LoRA from 0 (base model) to full and beyond, so you literally *watch the effect fade in*. Every travel can be anchored to a reference to hold the subject steady, with interpolation and seed-drift knobs for a smooth, brightness-even result. (The epoch morph shows the LoRA *learning*; the travels show what it can *do*.)

### Profiler
A per-block activation profile with a colour-coded, five-bucket HTML report — which blocks carry style, identity, and detail signal, and where they overlap. Writes a JSON sidecar that Repair Studio reads automatically, showing the findings inline when you load the same LoRA.

### Extract
Distil any Klein LoRA to a lower rank with block and timestep targeting. Fast presets run pure weight SVD with no GPU models loaded; activation-weighted presets use forward passes for better accuracy. Supports PEFT and LyCORIS (LoKR / LoHa) sources.

## Training

The foundation: fast, light, and tuned for one model.

- **Proven presets** for rank 4–16, single subject through multi-character — or roll your own.
- **Context LoRA** — load an existing LoRA as a frozen *active* layer so the new one learns to coexist. Train a face on top of a style and they stop fighting at inference; train an outfit on top of a character and the clothes drape correctly. No other trainer does this.
- **Distilled training samples** — 4-step previews that match ComfyUI output closely (a separate Distilled DiT, ComfyUI Euler Simple schedule). On by default; toggle on the Samples tab. On tight cards the sample model auto-swaps its own blocks by VRAM so 4-step previews keep working on 16 GB. On 24 GB+ it stays resident and is cached in system RAM between epochs (RAM-checked, saves ~3–4 s/epoch).
- **Reference-conditioned samples** — Klein is an edit model, so previews can *edit* a reference photo instead of generating from scratch. Auto-resized to ~0.20 MP so it can't OOM; works on Base and Distilled samples.
- **Adaptive LR** — a bi-directional plateau tracker that probes up on steady loss descent and pulls down (with optional weight rollback) on plateau, heavy gradient clipping, or weight-norm runaway.
- **Faster fp8 training** — on the fp8 Base DiT the frozen-base matmuls run in fp8 on the tensor cores (`torch._scaled_mm`, forward *and* backward) for **~1.5× faster steps**, no quality cost in testing. Automatic, no flag. Needs RTX 40/50-series; older cards fall back automatically.
- **Gradient checkpointing toggle** — on by default (it's what fits a 9B LoRA on 16 GB). Turn it **off** on a 24 GB+ card for meaningfully faster steps; the fp8 path keeps the `scaled_mm` speedup active either way, so 24/32 GB cards stack both wins. A VRAM-aware warning fires if you switch it off on a card that can't spare the activation memory.
- **Pause / Resume** — graceful epoch-boundary pause that frees your GPU mid-run and resumes with full optimizer state and no quality regression. Fire up Rocket League, come back, carry on.
- **Model Area targeting** — train only Identity, Style, or Detail blocks, or the full model.
- **Auto VRAM management** — block swap auto-detects from GPU VRAM; OOM detection tells you exactly what to change. Supports bf16 and fp8 Base DiT, with block swap.
- **Diffusers LoRA support** — OneTrainer LoRAs with split Q/K/V keys are auto-fused on load.

> **A note on Base previews:** the default Distilled 4-step previews track ComfyUI closely, including with a Context LoRA active. Only **Base multi-step** previews (Distilled toggled off) can look softer than the deployed LoRA — they come from a mid-training fp8 checkpoint, so colours and detail can be slightly off even when the LoRA is excellent. Judging from Base previews? Confirm final quality in ComfyUI.

### Live status bar
A bottom bar with stacked **VRAM and system-RAM gauges** (smooth gradient fills, plus a per-run peak marker so you can see how high a run pushed memory). VRAM is read at the device level, so it catches other apps holding the GPU too. A top-right **IDLE / BUSY** light shows at a glance whether the app is working. Hide or show the whole bar with one click; it remembers.

Beside it sits a **live sample override** — tick it to set a prompt, seed, width/height, and optional reference image for the *next* samples, mid-run, no restart. The text encoder only re-runs when the prompt text changes, so seed / resolution / reference tweaks are instant.

### Dataset prep
- **Florence-2 AI captioning** — bulk-generate detailed captions in one click.
- **Bilingual captions** — optionally append Chinese via Helsinki-NLP. Klein's Qwen3 text encoder has deep Chinese training, so bilingual captions act as text-level data augmentation, improving visual quality without changing loss.
- **Image Prep** — batch resize, PNG conversion, and InsightFace face-crop derivatives, with optional **gender targeting** (largest male/female face) so it locks onto your subject in group shots. Pairing a tight crop with a full shot adds a lot to a character dataset. Training defaults to ~512² (0.25 MP) and resizes in-cache, so any resolution or aspect ratio just works — nothing has to be square or pre-sized.

### Compatibility
Loads kohya, PEFT, OneTrainer (OMI + legacy), AI-Toolkit, and LyCORIS (LoKR / LoHa) — all auto-converted on load. LyCORIS files work for preview, profiling, and extraction; **bake** materialises them to a standard LoRA via GPU-accelerated SVD. Output is kohya-style `.safetensors` that drop straight into ComfyUI Klein nodes. Every tab links to the relevant section of the walkthrough video.

## Requirements

- **GPU** — NVIDIA RTX 30 / 40 / 50-series. **16 GB+ VRAM** recommended (24 GB+ comfortable). The fp8 *speedup* needs 40-series or newer (fp8 tensor cores); 30-series still gets the fp8 VRAM savings, just not the extra speed.
- **NVIDIA driver** — 555+ on Windows, 550+ on Linux (for the CUDA 12.8 PyTorch wheels).
- **OS** — Windows 10 / 11 or Linux. macOS handles captioning and image prep, but training needs CUDA.
- **Python** — 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, or 3.13.
- **Disk** — ~10 GB for the venv, plus ~40 GB for model files.
- **Visual Studio Build Tools** (Windows only) — needed to compile InsightFace. Install [Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) with the **"Desktop development with C++"** workload. Errors about `cl.exe` or a missing C++ compiler mean this is what's needed.

## Install

Clone the repo (or download the ZIP via the green **Code** button and extract):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shootthesound/Fizgig.git
cd Fizgig
```

**Windows (one-click)** — double-click `install_fizgig.bat`. It creates a venv, installs CUDA 12.8 PyTorch and all dependencies, pre-downloads the InsightFace models, and verifies CUDA is visible to PyTorch. Launch with `run_fizgig.bat`; update later with `update_fizgig.bat`.

**Linux / macOS:**

```bash
python install_fizgig.py
chmod +x run_fizgig.sh
./run_fizgig.sh
```

Three small models auto-download on first use: InsightFace `buffalo_l` (~300 MB, during install), Florence-2 (~500 MB–1.5 GB, first AI caption), and Helsinki-NLP `opus-mt-en-zh` (~300 MB, first bilingual translation).

## Model downloads (you provide)

Fizgig doesn't bundle weights — they're ~40 GB combined and licensing varies. Each row in the **Preferences** tab has a **Download** link to the right HuggingFace page.

| Model | File | Size | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Base DiT (fp8) — recommended** | `flux-2-klein-base-9b-fp8.safetensors` | ~9.5 GB fp8 | [black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-klein-base-9b-fp8](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-klein-base-9b-fp8) |
| Base DiT (bf16) | `flux-2-klein-base-9b.safetensors` | ~17 GB bf16 | [black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-klein-base-9B](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-klein-base-9B) |
| Distilled DiT | `flux-2-klein-9b-fp8.safetensors` | ~9 GB fp8 | [black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-klein-9b-fp8](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-klein-9b-fp8) |
| VAE / AE | `ae.safetensors` | ~320 MB | [black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-dev](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-dev/blob/main/ae.safetensors) (from root, **not** the `vae/` subfolder) |
| Text Encoder | `qwen_3_8b.safetensors` | ~15 GB | [Comfy-Org/vae-text-encorder-for-flux-klein-9b](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/vae-text-encorder-for-flux-klein-9b/blob/main/split_files/text_encoders/qwen_3_8b.safetensors) |

Training runs on the **Base DiT**, and the **fp8 version is recommended on every GPU**: same training quality at roughly half the VRAM (resident at ~9.6 GB, so a 9B LoRA trains in ~14 GB and fits a 16 GB card).

- **RTX 40 / 50-series** — you *also* get **~1.5× faster steps**: the frozen-base matmuls run in fp8 on the tensor cores (`torch._scaled_mm`, automatic).
- **RTX 30-series and older** — the speedup is skipped automatically (no fp8 tensor cores), but you keep the full VRAM savings and the same quality, so fp8 Base is still worth it.

It's all automatic — Fizgig detects pre-quantised files and the right path for your GPU, so you never need to touch the "FP8 Base" checkbox (the bf16 version works too if you prefer). The **Distilled DiT** powers the fast 4-step previews — on by default during training, and always used in the Profiler, Repair Studio, and Explorer — so grab both if you'll use the workbench.

## VRAM guidance

**Inference tools** (Profiler / Repair Studio / Explorer / Extract) on Distilled 4-step:

| Block Swap | Min VRAM | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 24 GB+ | No swap — fastest |
| 4 | 20 GB | Light swap |
| 8 | 16 GB | Moderate swap |
| 12 | 14 GB | Aggressive swap |
| 16 | 12 GB | Maximum swap — slower, but fits |

**Training** — the fp8 Base DiT stays resident at ~9.6 GB (not dequantised to bf16), so a 9B LoRA fits comfortably in **16 GB** — around 14 GB observed at block-swap 0 with a Context LoRA active, a little less without. VRAM scales with resolution and batch size; raise block swap to fit smaller cards.

**Smaller cards — 4-bit (NF4) base.** fp8 training needs ~14 GB: it fits a 16 GB card with no swap, but a **10–12 GB card has to block-swap**, paying a PCIe-transfer penalty every step. The opt-in **4-bit (NF4) base** mode (the *4-bit Base* toggle in Memory & FP8 / FP4) quantizes the frozen base to 4-bit — halving DiT VRAM to ~5.6 GB so a full 9B LoRA trains in **~7.5 GB**, which fits 10–12 GB cards with **no swap at all** (and so beats fp8-with-swap on those cards). The LoRA still trains in bf16 on top, QLoRA-style, and the base loads layer-by-layer so the card never holds the whole model. It's a lower-precision base, so it's a slight quality trade — always check the output in ComfyUI — and **16 GB+ cards should stick with fp8** (same quality, plus the speedup, no swap).

**DiT Block Swap (inference)** in Preferences applies only to the workbench tools. Training has its own separate block-swap setting, and its Distilled samples auto-swap by VRAM — so this preference never touches a training run. On first launch Fizgig auto-detects your VRAM and picks a sensible default; once you choose a value, your choice sticks.

## Getting started

Launch Fizgig and work left-to-right through the numbered tabs:

1. **Start** — set your training image folder. If model paths aren't configured, a prompt points you to Preferences.
2. **Image Prep** (optional) — resize, PNG-convert, or face-crop your images.
3. **Captions** — write trigger-word captions or generate with Florence-2; optionally translate to bilingual English + Chinese.
4. **Samples** — configure the preview prompts that render during training (Distilled 4-step on by default).
5. **Training** — pick a preset, tune, click **Start Training**.

The unnumbered tabs are the post-training workbench — and work on any Klein LoRA you've downloaded: **Profiler**, **Repair Studio**, **LoRA the Explorer**, **LoRA Royale**, **Extract**, and **Preferences** (model paths, output directories, inference block-swap preset, default Browse folders).
